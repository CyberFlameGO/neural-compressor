   Bases: :py:obj:`neural_compressor.adaptor.tf_utils.graph_rewriter.graph_base.GraphRewriterBase`

   Graph Rewrite Base class.
   We abstract this base class and define the interface only.

   :param object: the input model to be converted.
   :type object: model

   .. py:method:: do_transformation()

      Rename FusedBatchNorm op to FusedBatchNormV2.

      This pass is needed for bf16 conversion. Due to TensorFlow historical reason,
      FusedBatchNorm is not a bf16 op but FusedBatchNormV2 is. As the latter is compatible
      with the former, changing FusedBatchNorm op to FusedBatchNormV2 op will be able to
      convert to bf16 op on the platforms supporting VNNI_BF16 and AMX instructions.

      :returns: Modified graph with BN ops renamed.

      :raises ValueError: If the graph is badly formed.
